Sure! Here's a simple text-based Python game. Let's create a number guessing game where the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.

```python
import random

def guess_number():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it.")

    while True:
        guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))

        attempts += 1

        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low! Try a higher number.")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high! Try a lower number.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {secret_number} correctly in {attempts} attempts!")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_number()
```
